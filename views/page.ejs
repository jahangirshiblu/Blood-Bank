        <h1> Why Become A Donar</h1>

        <p>Blood You Donate Gives Someone Another Chance At Life. One Day That Someone May Be A Close Relative, A
          Friend, A Loved One—Or Even You.
          Most blood donation platforms are not too keen on the concept of privacy and security of the donors,
          making their contact details public and available for anyone to see.
          We at bloodfile.
          com have covered this loop by providing a platform that is not just free for both the donors and receiver but
          is also very keen on security and privacy of our donors.</p>

          <p>A blood donation truly is a “gift of life” that a healthy individual can give to others in their community
            who are sick or injured. In one hour’s time, a person can donate one unit of blood that can be separated
            into four individual components that could help save multiple lives.

            From one unit of blood, red blood cells can be extracted for use in trauma or surgical patients. Plasma, the
            liquid part of blood, is administered to patients with clotting problems. The third component of blood,
            platelets, clot the blood when cuts or other open wounds occur, and are often used in cancer and transplant
            patients. Cryoprecipitated anti-hemophilic factor (AHF) is also used for clotting factors.

            In a recent study supported by the <b><a
              href="http://www.aabb.org/tm/donation/Pages/Blood-Bank-Locator.aspx">National Blood Foundation</a></b>
              (TRANSFUSION 2002;42:122S), more than 5,000
            individuals who were current blood donors at the time or who had given blood in the past were asked why they
            donate blood. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents said that they give blood to help others. Respondents
            also said that giving blood makes them feel good about themselves; supports their local communities and
            hospitals; supports their community culture; and “pays back” society for the times when they or their
            families have needed blood transfusions in the past.

            For all of these reasons and more, donating blood is a good idea. To find out more about where to donate
            blood locally, use <b><a href="http://www.aabb.org/research/nbf/Pages/default.aspx">AABB’s locator</a></b>.</p>
